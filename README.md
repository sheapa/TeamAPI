## Assignment

API Coding Challenge

For the most part, this process will follow the pattern described here: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio
We will use .NET 6 along with either Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code to create a small web app.

Assessment:
Set up a web API project to interact with a database containing Teams and Players.
Ignore the parts about calling the API with jQuery â€“ we will be testing your application just by hitting certain endpoints with PostMan. This is not a UI test.

Guidelines:
Create an entity framework DbContext that models Team and Player objects.
A Team should contain an ID, a Name, a Location, and a List of Players on the team.
-	No two Teams should exist with the same Name and Location
-	A Team should have a maximum of 8 Players
-	Name and Location are required fields
A Player should contain an ID, a FirstName, and a LastName
-	A Player can only be on one Team
-	First Name, and Last Name are required fields

(The tutorial shows you how to set it up as an in-memory database so you donâ€™t have to worry about using a real database.)

Create endpoints that allow us to:
-	Create a Team
-	Create a Player
-	Add or Remove a Player from a Team
-	Query for Players
    o	Query by ID
    o	Query All Players
    o	Query All Players matching a given Last Name
    o	Query for all Players on a Team
-	Query for Teams
    o	Query by ID
    o	Query All Teams
    o	Query All Teams ordered by Name or Location

For example, we should be able to:
-	Send a POST request containing a Player object and create a new Player
-	Send a GET request and see all teams ordered by their name (sorted alphabetically)


## Method
1. Create ASP.Net Core Web API project in Visual Studio.
2. Design Player & Team models.
3. Add Nuget Package "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory", Create Database Context & Register Database Context.
4. Scaffold a controller using Entity Framework.
5. Create custom endpoints.
6. Test with Postman & Refactor.


## Functionality & Instructions For Testing End Points
1.) (Landing Page) Query All Teams : https://localhost:[Port]/api/Teams
    * Displays comprehensive list of teams.
    
2.) Query Teams Alphabetically : https://localhost:[Port]/api/Teams/sort
    * Displays comprehensive list of teams ordered alphabetically.
    
3.) Query Teams by Location : https://localhost:[Port]/api/Teams/location
    * Displays comprehensive list of teams ordred by location.

4.) Query Team by TeamID : https://localhost:[Port]/api/Teams/{TeamID}
    * Displays team selected by team ID.
    
5.) Query All Players : https://localhost:[Port]/api/players
    * Displays comprehensive list of players.
    
6.) Query Player by ID : https://localhost:[Port]/api/players/{PlayerID}
    * Displays player selected by player ID.
    
7.) Query Player by LastName : https://localhost:[Port]/api/players/?lastname={lastName}
    * Displays player selected by player last name.
    
8.) Create a team :  https://localhost:[Port]/api/teams
    * Add a team to in memory database. Send JSON team object to above address through postman post.
    
9.) Create a player :  https://localhost:[Port]/api/players
    * Add a player to in memory database. Send JSON player object to above address through postman post

10.) Add a player to a team : https://localhost:7284/api/teams/{teamId)
    * Add a player to a team. Send existing player ID throught postman patch to above address.
    
11.)Remove a player :  https://localhost:[Port]/api/players{playerId}
    * Deletes player from team. Send existing player ID through postman delete to above address.
    
## Seed Data
